abstract: The proliferation of political memes in modern information campaigns calls
  for efficient solutions for image classification by ideological affiliation. While
  significant advances have recently been made on text classification in modern natural
  language processing literature, understanding the political insinuation in imagery
  is less developed due to the hard nature of the problem. Unlike text, where meaning
  arises from juxtaposition of tokens (words) within some common linguistic structures,
  image semantics emerge from a much less constrained process of fusion of visual
  concepts. Thus, training a model to infer visual insinuation is possibly a more
  challenging problem. In this paper, we explore an alternative unsupervised approach
  that, instead, infers ideological affiliation from image propagation patterns on
  social media. The approach is shown to improve the F1-score by over 0.15 (nearly
  25%) over previous unsupervised baselines, and then by another 0.05 (around 7%)
  in the presence of a small amount of supervision.
