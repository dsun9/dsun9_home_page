abstract: Recent re-opening policies in the US, following a period of social distancing
  measures, introduced a significant increase in daily COVID-19 infections, calling
  for a roll-back or substantial revisiting of these policies in many states. The
  situation is suggestive of difficulties modeling the impact of partial distancing/re-opening
  policies on future epidemic spread for purposes of choosing safe alternatives. More
  specifically, one needs to understand the impact of manipulating the availability
  of social interaction venues (e.g., schools, workplaces, and retail establishments)
  on virus spread. We introduce a model, inspired by social networks research, that
  answers the above question. Our model compartmentalizes interaction venues into
  categories we call mixing domains, enabling one to predict COVID-19 contagion trends
  in different geographic regions under different what if assumptions on partial re-opening
  of individual domains. We apply our model to several highly impacted states showing
  (i) how accurately it predicts the extent of current resurgence (from available
  policy descriptions), and (ii) what alternatives might be more effective at mitigating
  the second wave. We further compare policies that rely on partial venue closure
  to policies that espouse wide-spread periodic testing instead (i.e., in lieu of
  social distancing). Our models predict that the benefits of (mandatory) testing
  out-shadow the benefits of partial venue closure, suggesting that perhaps more efforts
  should be directed to such a mitigation strategy.
